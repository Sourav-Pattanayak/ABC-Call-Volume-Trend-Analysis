# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis
In this CX analytics project, i have analyzed inbound call data for an insurance company to determine average call duration, visualized call volume trends, and proposed optimal agent allocation to reduce abandon rates. Additionally, i have addressed night shift calls, ensuring a 10% abandon rate while considering agent workdays and working hours.
